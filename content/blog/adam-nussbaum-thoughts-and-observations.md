The legendary [Adam Nussbaum](http://www.adamnussbaum.net/) wrote. Not only for the drummers.

> Drummers are very often the victim of jokes. We all know this one, a club owner asks &#8220;how many are in the band&#8221; and he&#8217;s told, &#8220;we have four musicians and a drummer!&#8221;.

> The drummer should strive to be a good musician as a rule, not an exception. I&#8217;d like to state that what I&#8217;m writing here is nothing new, I&#8217;m just constantly reminded of these realities.

> _Why_?

> So many drummers I&#8217;ve heard are just drumming away, working on licks, not on playing musically. _Music_ is a language. We must remember that we are obliged to serve it, and respect it. The _music_ itself, and the people you play it with dictate the conception of how it is to be interpreted.

> Because we make the other musicians in the group _sound_ good and _feel_ good. If we take a moment to think about it, most all the drummers we admire do that first. When the band sounds good you sound good. The _music_ is our main priority, our foremost responsibility. Like the scouts say &#8220;Be prepared&#8221;.

> _What do I mean?_

> Well, for one, most _music_ is usually made up of melody, harmony, rhythm and form. To be able to perform appropriately, we must try to internalize what these components are in order to play and respond accordingly.
> 
> _How do the instruments in a group play together?_
> 
> Check out the relationship of the instruments in the rhythm section. _Listen_ for how they function independently and together. How do they support and react to one another? the soloist? To really understand this we must _listen_ to the _music_ as a whole entity, not just the drums.
> 
> We have to really learn and absorb many styles, familiarize ourselves with song forms, different rhythmic feels, melodic shapes, harmonic motion, the balance of ideas in a composition&#8230; This list is endless. It is only limited by the restrictions of our imagination.
> 
> The way we play should have to do with what is going on around us. We need to have enough of a musical conception and technical ability so we can take care of what&#8217;s happening around us in the moment, without having to stop to think about it. This has to be second nature, just like walking and talking. We don&#8217;t think about that process any more, we&#8217;ve learned it. Now we just do it. It&#8217;s the same with _music_. We must be in the moment, in the now, to listen, feel and respond to what&#8217;s happening around us.

> Listen to the greats. Practice and play with as many different people as you can. If we want to play better, we must get involved with the process of playing. Keep an open mind and an open ear.

> It&#8217;s an infinite journey that never ends&#8230;Enjoy it!

Sounds so fresh, although written many years ago, nowadays and forever.
